            <h2><b>THINGS I'VE SEEN</b></h2>
            <p>I was born into a world full of uncertainties and mysteries, but there are faces I've seen, some I don't know and some close to me, 
                and each one of them helps in shaping who I am today. I've seen the laughter of my friends, the care of my family, and whenever I see the rain, 
                I feel a sense of emptiness, feels as if the world around me slowly quiets down with each droplet of the rain. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <h2><b>PHASES OF MY LIFE</b></h2>
            <p> As the only son, Iâ€™ve always felt the weight of expectations, pressures, and disappointments. All my life, I am driven and pushed to excel in academics 
                which is fine to me. But sometimes it's tiring to balance these expectations along with my current self. Burning with my own passions still needs to shape me, 
                It must help me/teach me the value of perseverance and the pursuit of knowledge with every step I take. And currently right now, I'm still lacking.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <h2><b>WHAT MY LIFE MEANS</b></h2>
            <p>My life means endless. It feels like a void, where the efforts I put into learning and growing seem to disappear into emptiness. 
               Despite my achievements, a sense of meaning ponders me, leaving me questioning the purpose behind it all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box tall">
            <h2><b>LESSONS I'VE LEARNED</b></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Perfection is an illusion; effort in struggles is what truly matters.</li>
                <li>Reality hits different.</li>
                <li>Being in silence is powerful; it allows me to reflect and understand a world that is chaotic and overwhelming.</li>
                <li>Disappointment reveals who stays and who leaves, teaching you that some people are only meant to be in your life for a season.</li>
                <li>Darkness can reveal hidden strength, even when purpose feels distant.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <h2><b>SUCCESSES AND HIGHLIGHTS</b></h2>
            <p>Success for me is not only in academic recognitions but also in overcoming my struggles in life, 
               like managing my self-doubts and pushing myself to keep improving. Whenever I finish a task whether it's group or individual,
               I always feel a sense of satisfaction that is actually my source of pride and motivation to continue moving forward.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <h2><b>MY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND CULTURE</b></h2>
            <p>My Family has always been a source of support for me. 
               Ever since I was a child, I learned values like respect, kindness, and the importance of staying true to myself.
               Even though I rarely show my real and serious self, the lessons I've learned guide me as I navigate both my personal 
               and academic life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <h2><b>TRIBUTES TO PEOPLE I'VE KNOWN</b></h2>
            <p>To my family, friends, and teachers, thank you for teaching me values. Thank you for believing in me, especially during times when I 
               mostly doubted myself and lost interest in things I'm doing. Your support keeps me striving to live on, and I am forever grateful 
               for the lessons and encouragement you've given me. Thank you po.</p>

            <h2><b>SADDEST DAY OF MY LIFE</b></h2>
            <p>Currently, the saddest day of my life was when my Lolo passed away while I was at school. 
               I didn't cry; I didn't show how I felt. Instead, I left with a blank space and felt empty and very sad as I went back to 
               the table where my friends were waiting for me as I got my food for lunch.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="last-box">
            <h2><b>HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE</b></h2>
            <p>My happiest day of my life is every day. I wake up, go to school, and see my friends. I can communicate and have fun with my family too.
               I spend all my day trying to end it with a smile as always. But sometimes, or mostly, it doesn't end that way.</p>
